# Training

Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials (SUPPORT) Units are locally accessible, multidisciplinary clusters of specialized research resources, policy knowledge, and patient perspective. SUPPORT Units provide the necessary expertise to pursue patient-oriented research and help lead reforms in response to locally-driven health care needs. One of the primary objectives of the Maritime SPOR SUPPORT Unit (MSSU) is to Advance methods and training in comparative effectiveness research and develop the next generation of methodologists.

The SPOR External Advisory Committee on Training and Career Development completed extensive literature reviews and found consensus around the essential characteristics of successful training and career environments in patient-oriented research. The following are adapted from their Report on Training and Career Development in Patient-Oriented Research.

Essential characteristics of training environments in patient-oriented research:

• Multidisciplinary mentorship

• Training in multiple environments

• Professional skills development

• Best practices and resource sharing

Essential characteristics of career support in patient-oriented research:

*   Balance and value of clinical and academic goals
*   Explicit and equitable job expectations, resource provision and compensation
*   Expectation of, and support for, systematic mentorship
