<h1>Bio-Cluster Research</h1>

<p>The CHCR is engaged in studies on cluster dynamics and sustainability for the PEI life science and biotechnology cluster.&nbsp; Biotechnology is an important, growing sector within Prince Edward Island and the CHCR provides research and collaborations to examine the state of the PEI Biotechnology cluster both in the present and in the future. Our research revolves around key policy questions that were designed in collaboration with stakeholders.</p>

<p> In collaboration with the PEI BioAlliance, Dr. Steven Casper of Keck Graduate Institute in California, and Diane Alleva Caceres of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, the CHCR created and conducted a comprehensive survey in 2009 and again in 2013 to track the PEI cluster growth in areas such as human resources, external resources, governance, networks, and financing. These five areas helped depict the sustainability and stage of the biotechnology cluster in PEI and focused on two questions: how healthy is the PEI biotechnology industry and how healthy is the workforce pipeline?</p>

<p> In addition to this research, the CHCR works closely with collaborators in the industry to identify key research areas, develop networking events and conferences, and to evaluate and improve skills development and training within the Biotechnology cluster.</p>
