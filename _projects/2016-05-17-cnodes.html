<h1>CNODES</h1>

<p>The Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES) was established in 2011 as part of the Drug Safety and Effectiveness (DSEN) initiative. CNODES aims to rapidly answer questions about drug safety and effectiveness using population-based studies, and currently uses administrative health care databases from eight Canadian provinces (BC, AB, SK, MB, ON, QC, NS, NL), the UK-based CPRD database, and the US-based MarketScan database. The province of Prince Edward Island (PEI) holds administrative databases similar to those of these other provinces, and there is considerable interest within the province to contribute to CNODES projects.</p>

<p>This project will directly support the development of health research capacity for observational drug safety and effectiveness studies in the province of PEI. Specifically, this project will determine the value of the administrative health care databases with the province of PEI for conducting observational pharmacoepidemiologic studies by replicating two recent CNODES studies that evaluated the potential adverse effects of a class of cholesterol lowering drugs called statins. This demonstration project will replicate the analytic protocols for a CNODES study that evaluated the association between statin use and the occurrence of acute kidney injury, and a CNODES study that evaluated the association between statin use and the occurrence of diabetes after a heart attack or stroke.</p>

<p>PEI would be the ninth province to contribute to CNODES projects. Indeed, the integration of PEI as a full member of CNODES aligns with the goals of DSEN to build capacity across Canada in the area of post-marketing drug safety and effectiveness research.</p>
